Help, I am I trapped in a job factory in jobland where jobs grow on jobbies, put on your job hunting hat jump into a job cannon and grab a job or I'm afraid it's curtains for me. Please, they're not giving me any food and I don't know how much longer I can last!

Current openings:

- chef
- dishwasher
- server
- SANDWICH
- social media pimp

Send your resume my any time from 00:00 to 23:59, please I need help. I cannot emphasize this enough, you are my only hope!
